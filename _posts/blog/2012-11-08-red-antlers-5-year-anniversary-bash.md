Last Thursday was the 5th birthday party of Red Antler. It was honestly, probably the best party I have ever been a part of. In preparation for the party we decked out our space, built glowing wall sculptures, had a disco ball and lights for the dance floor installed, created animations across all of our screens. We had ping pong, drunk face-painting, people getting crazy on the dance floor, and plenty of beer. Can’t wait for next year. Maybe 6 will be even bigger.
