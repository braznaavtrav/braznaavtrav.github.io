My friend at work, [Elliot Scott](http://mondayne.com) ([flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mondayne/)), took pictures of many of the employees at Landor the other day. He then paired up people together and managed to morph features of each person’s faces on to one another. The result is both hideously terrifying and strangely appealing. And for some strange reason many of the morphs end up looking like washed up rock musicians. Hopefully, soon, he will add all of the morphs as a flickr set. Good-on-ya-mate (as he would say).
