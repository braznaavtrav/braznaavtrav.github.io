The Best Years of Our Lives has become one of my favorite movies, mainly for the way it has the ability to tell stories with only individual shots. My picking-up on this could have been sparked by my recently stoked love of comics, but I really do think that each of these shots genuinely tell a story and create a cinematic symphony when they come together. The movie isnâ€™t nearly quite as avant-garde as these stills would lead you to believe, but it is still a fantastic film.
