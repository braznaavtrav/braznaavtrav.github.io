Today was my first day as an employee of the renowned, Brooklyn-based branding agency Red Antler. Known for their work with clients such as Behance, NYC Media Lab, Susie Cakes, and most recently, TicketLeap, which I was promptly put to work on (See Brand New), it seems like Red Antler is always producing very exciting and fun work for consumer-focused clients; many of which are web-based. It was a great first day and I am very much looking forward to my time there.
