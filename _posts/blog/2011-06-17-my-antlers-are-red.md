Today was my first day as an employee of the renowned, Brooklyn-based branding agency [Red Antler](http://redantler.com). Known for their work with clients such as [Behance](http://www.behance.com/), [NYC Media Lab](http://nycmedialab.net/), [Susie Cakes](https://www.susiecakes.com/), and most recently, [TicketLeap](http://www.ticketleap.com/), which I was promptly put to work on ([See Brand New](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/ticketleap_ditches_frog.php)), it seems like Red Antler is always producing very exciting and fun work for consumer-focused clients; many of which are web-based. It was a great first day and I am very much looking forward to my time there.
