Alternative comic book writer and illustrator Jordan Crane has recently become a great inspiration of mine. The way he treats tone and mood is fantastic. His subject matter spans a number of topics, from relationship problems and death and murder to flying in the clouds with birds. Many of his comics are at the same time melancholic and surreal. A lot of the comics are black-and-white but a few are duotone or full color. When he does use color, especially on the covers of his comic books, he uses it in a smartly and beautifully restrained manner. The way he uses light to present space is deliberate and smart.
