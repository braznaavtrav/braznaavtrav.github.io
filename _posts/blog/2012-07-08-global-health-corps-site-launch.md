[Global Health Corps](http://ghcorps.org) is a global non-profit that seeks to provide health equity to impoverished areas in Africa. I recently had the honor to design and develop Global Health Corps’ [new website](http://ghcorps.org).

Global Health Corps pairs fellows native to the countries they do work in with fellows from out of the country. These brilliant fellows, ranging from being Architects to Engineers to Doctors, all share the same passion and goal: to further the movement of global health equity. The new site focuses on showcasing these true heros.

It always an amazing feeling when I can do what I love and help people out at the same time.
