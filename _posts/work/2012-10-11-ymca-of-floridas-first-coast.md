While working at [Brown Dog Creative](http://browndogcreative.com) in Jacksonville, FL, I had the privilege of redesigning (and doing front-end development on) First Coast YMCAâ€™s website to align with their new, global brand. Depending on the time of day, the color scheme of the site changes to give it a fresh feel each time a user visits.
