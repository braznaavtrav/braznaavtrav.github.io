Blue Jack Brewery is a microbrewery in Gainesville, FL. They name their beers after historical and pop-culture figures. The acorn used to brand brewery is symbolic of the Blue Jack Oak, which shares its native Southeastern land with the microbrewery. Illustrations and taglines were created for each beer. The artwork is printed directly onto the bottles instead of using paper and glue.
