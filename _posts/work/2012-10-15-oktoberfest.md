As a celebration for the end of my internship at Landor, I threw a digital Oktoberfest inspired kegger, complete with a photo booth, beer pong, pretzels and sausages. I created an interactive invitation to the party, as well as posters and props for the photo booth. The party was an absolution smash (after all, how can you go wrong with a keg).
