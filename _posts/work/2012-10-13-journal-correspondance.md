One of my good friends and college professors, [Loren Myhre](http://lorenmyhre.blogspot.com), and I have been mailing a sketchbook back-and-forth. We collage and build upon each other’s work. We have been working on it on and off for over a year and a half and so far only about 10 pages have any thing on them. The first few pages have been collaged on so many times that they have become rock hard. Loren puts it best when describing it:

> I question if this is a journal at all-time is absent in the work…there is not a sense of lapsed time. One page rolls into the next, images collide and are reshuffled-there are no declarations of a new day and new mood. It is however a correspondence-a wordless exchange. A nod is more powerful than a hello.
