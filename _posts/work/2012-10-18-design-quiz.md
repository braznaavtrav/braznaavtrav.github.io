Comedically written like a quiz from a teenage girly magazine, “Should I Dump My Design?” is an interactive “tool” that designers can use to see if the design they are working on is ready for the world (I put “tool” in quotation marks because it is really more of a game, I don’t expect designers to actually use this and grade their work against it, that’s what brains are for). Illustrations by Rietje Gieskes.
