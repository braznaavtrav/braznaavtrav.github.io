In August of 2010 [Hiller Goodspeed](http://hillergoodspeed.tumblr.com/) and I started a tumblr called EDPED (Everyday Posters Everyday). The basic idea behind EDPED was to celebrate life by creating fictional show posters for the everyday, mundane occurrences of life. Since it’s creation, EDPED has been featured on The Onion’s A.V Club, Under Consideration’s Quipsologies, How Magazine’s Design Blog, some Australian magazine called Girlfriend (rly? wtf?) and was ranked number 5 in BuzzFeed’s best new Tumblr blog’s of 2010 (better than Kim Jong Il looking at things)!
