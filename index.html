    <p class="lead">But maybe, far in the future, dogs have evolved and learned how to read and use the internet and you are a dog. Back in the time when I was created dogs only said "bark".

I was born with neither the ability to see nor the ability to detect the subtle differences in usage patterns between humans and future dogs. <br>You see, I am merely a website.</p>

    <p class="lead">Why, thank you.</p>
    <p class="lead">You&apos;re so kind.</p>
    <p class="lead">Now, now.</p>
